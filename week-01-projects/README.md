# Week 1 In-class projects


## Project 1: Build a responsive cookie store web page

1. Add Bootstrap
    - Use the CDN link tag
2. Apply the bootstrap grid classes
    - The 4 cookie products should appear side by side in one row on large screens
    - The 4 cookies should appear one per row on smaller screens
    - ![grid](screenshots/cookie-store-grid.png)
3. Apply styling to make the page look as follows:
    - On larger screens:
    - ![larger screens](screenshots/cookie-store-large-screen.png)
    - On smaller screens:
    - ![smaller screens](screenshots/cookie-store-mobile-screen.png)
4. Using only bootstrap styles, and not moving any html tags, make the cookie products alternate as follows on larger screens:
    - ![larger screens](screenshots/cookie-store-large-screen-alt.png)
    - _Hint:_ Look into the push and pull classes
    - *Clarifications*
        + _Don't_ change the order of the 3 main cookie html tags, the `h3`, followed by the `p`, and then the `img` tags. _Remember, we want to keep semantic order._
        + You can add `div`'s and bootstrap classes as needed, you can wrap any tags in divs as needed, as long as you don't change the order.
